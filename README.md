# Language Game (Real name coming at some point)

Hi welcome to my project. I'll add documentation here to explain everything but as a general overview;

This project came to mind from playing around with CSS animations and creating a cool little crt monitor effect, the effect was cool and so: here it is, the idea that came from it.

This project uses Zustand to keep logic together and Jest for unit testing to make sure I don't accidentally add content that can't be accessed

Stack:
  - Vite React
  - TypeScript
  - Jest
  - Zustand

To come:
  - Basic UI art
  - Replace human words with language symbols
  - Add space for the player to write their interpretation about each symbol
  - Saving/Loading
  - Chat history
  - Evidence
  - Actual dialogue trees and story
  - Music? Maybe

# Change log:

  - Added Jest for testing to make sure the game remains playable after adding content
